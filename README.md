## Introduction

This project's mission is to develop, test, and deploy automated machine learning-based methods to sift ('mine') through 
transit photometry data from exoplanet survey missions such as Kepler and TESS and inform subject matter experts (SMEs) 
on potential transiting planet candidates.

### Current main goals

The main goals of the `ExoMiner` project are:

1. Perform classification of transit signals in Kepler and TESS data;
2. Create vetted catalogs of Threshold Crossing Events (TCEs) for Kepler and TESS runs for the exoplanet community.
3. Validate new exoplanets using Kepler and TESS data.

## ExoMiner Pipeline [**NEW**]

![Pipeline Demo - Show pipeline run using the terminal](/others/media/2_run_exominer_pipeline_edited.gif)

The [ExoMiner Pipeline](/exominer_pipeline) is a fully integrated pipeline from TIC IDs to ExoMiner prediction scores 
for the corresponding 
TESS SPOC TCEs in 2-min/FFI data. This pipeline makes use of Podman as a container framework to provide a seamless 
experience to the user - no need for setting up the code repository and install package dependencies! Simply get the 
Podman image for your system's architecture using the [manifest](/docs/getting-started.md#pulling-the-image). See the 
documentation in [here](/docs/index.md) to get started.

For those interested in running the pipeline without resorting to Podman, see 
[Running the pipeline without Podman](/docs/running-exominer-pipeline.md#running-the-pipeline-without-podman).

## Repository Overview

The repository consists of the following main blocks:

1. Data preprocessing: preprocess data products (e.g. light curve FITS files) to generate a catalog of transit signal 
features to be used for training and evaluating models, and to run inference on it. Code under
[src_preprocessing](/src_preprocessing).
2. Model training/evaluation/prediction: train and evaluate models on the preprocessed data. Run inference on the data 
using trained models. Code under [src](/src).
3. Model evaluation using cross-validation under [src_cv](/src_cv).
4. Hyperparameter Optimization: use code under [src_hpo](src_hpo) to run hyperparameter optimization experiments to 
find an optimized architecture for a given task.
5. Model Development: use code under [models](models) to access and modify ExoMiner architectures. 

## Source Data

All data used in this project are publicly available. Generally, the data used consist of:

- TCE and Objects of Interest (e.g. KOI and TOI catalogs) tables available in archives/respositories such as
  [NExSci](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/),
  [ExoFOP](https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/), [TEV](https://tev.mit.edu/data/) and
  [MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/);
- Light curve and target pixel FITS files created by the Kepler/TESS Missions, and data products generated by the Kepler/TESS Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC) available in archives such as the [MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/).

## Models

Models currently implemented in [models](models/models_keras.py):

1. `ExoMiner++` [**CURRENT**]: Improved architecture for TESS. Used in TESS paper (see [References](#references)).
